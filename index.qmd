## Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is the training material for grpEHR.

Currently there are two parts; an [introduction to Git and GitHub](01-index.qmd) with a [short practical exercise](01-12-short-practical.qmd) to complete, and [best practice](02-index.qmd).

You can use the menu of the left handside to navigate between parts and pages, and use the menu on the right handside to navigate between sections within a page.

If you spot any typos or areas for improvement do click the _View source_ link on the right menu and submit a PR to the repo with your suggestions.
